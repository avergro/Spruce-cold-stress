Here guides used in Spruce's transcriptomics data analysis are included.

This directory contains Biological Quality Analysis (BiologicalQA) and Differential Expression (DE) scripts for each tissue (needles and roots) and details about the steps followed to analyze the publication data.  

RNA-Seq pipeline and accesory code like plot.multidensity.R script which is necessary for BiologicalQA analysis deveolped by Bioinformatics UPSC groups is avilable here:

A detailed version of the workflow is available on Wiki:
